## Is Air travel the safest form of Transportation?<BR><BR>
The general perception is that air travel accidents are risky. The air crash is tragic with more loss with respect to life and property. As they are dangerous the media tends to broadcast about the loss to the public. But the real question is airline travel is dangerous? Yes, when air accidents occur, they are dangerous, whereas the number of airline accidents is extremely rare. Statistically speaking, they are so rare that the transportation by airlines is safer, and it has been safer with an increase in usage of technology with includes bigdata. The same can be reflected in the below points.
<li>The airline with the most number of fatal accidents during1985-1999 has worked towards safety and reduced the numbers in 2000-2014. I prefer not to show the airline names to the external audience.
<li>Fatal Accidents, Incidents, and Fatalities have decreased drastically over the years. Comparing the data from 1985-99 vs 2000-14. We notice that “50.61% Reduction in Fatalities, 42.53% Reduction in Incidents, 69.67% Reduction in Fatal Accidents”.
<li>The airline industry has worked on reducing the number of fatal accidents over the 30 years. The graph below shows the top 5 airlines with the most number of fatal accidents in 85-99. The airline industries had worked on improvements with technology to make air travel safe. Hence, In the years 2000-2014, the number of fatal accidents has reduced dramatically. 
<li>If we compare the number of automobile crashes with the number of airlines. By looking at the stats, we notice that the number of Air crashes is very low compared to automobile crashes. Automobile crashes are in 30K vs airline crashes are under 300.
<li>The Number of passengers who have preferred to travel both international and Domestic has increased drastically with the increase in the world population. This shows that, People are more confident and willing to travel by air.
<li>There are 45,000 Average daily flights handled. 5,400 Aircrafts in the sky at peak operation times.
<li>OpRevenues(mils) is expected to cross 900K(mils)in coming years and the Number of Crashes has reduced lesser than 100. With an increasing number of domestic and international passengers, we will notice that the Revenue to be increased. As outlined in the below chart, the airline’s Operating revenue is increasing over the years and the years to come. Although the number of passengers increased, the number of crashes has decreased drastically. This shows that air travel is safe.
Based on the data above, the airline industry has put a good foot forward to implement the technology to improve each traveler's experience better. Which is clearly accepted by people around the world (the same is reflected in the passenger count). So, we can conclude that Airline travel is safe.<BR><BR>
