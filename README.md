#### Employee Attrition (https://github.com/RamizuddinS/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/P1_Predicting%20Employee%20Attrition)
According to the FinancesOnline Review for Business, There are around 18.9 million Americans either exit the labor force or change occupation every year. Around 3.5 million workers quit their jobs at the beginning of 2020. The average turnover rate in the U.S. is about 20% annually. In February, the number of total separations initiated changed to 6.1 million and 4.1 percent. Attrition will cause a big issue for organizations both in-process and in cost. If an organization performs successfully, the organization and the employee should have a good relationship and understanding. When an employee decides to quit, there will be a lot of challenges for the organization. It will impact their productivity, revenue, experience, and time invested in training the employee. There is around $630Billion in overall costs of employee turnover in the US. The cost of replacing an employee who resigned is around 33% of the employee's annual salary. So, it is important for employers to understand why employees are leaving the company. Using the dataset from Kaggle to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘The time is taken to travel from home to work is a factor for attrition, Among critical factors, is Monthly income a factor to keep employees happy, Will the highly educated employees more tend to leave the organization, Work-life balance relates to employee retention.
#### Credit Card Approval (https://github.com/RamizuddinS/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/P4%20Credit%20Card%20Approval)
Credit card issuing institutions are becoming meticulous in approving credit cards for customers. In addition, the downturn of financial institutions during the US subprime mortgage and the European sovereign crisis has raised concerns about risk management properly. Hence, these challenges have attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners. A wide range of statistical and machine learning techniques have been developed to solve credit card related problems. It is found that machine learning techniques are superior to other traditional statistical techniques in dealing with credit scoring. The decision of approving a credit card or loan is majorly dependent on the personal and financial background of the applicant. There are two basic risks: one is a business loss that results from not approving the good candidate, and the other is the financial loss that results from approving the candidate who is at bad risk. It is very important to manage credit risk and handle challenges efficiently for credit decisions as it can have adverse effects on credit management. Therefore, evaluation of credit approval is significant before jumping to any granting decision.

#### Death During Analysis(https://github.com/RamizuddinS/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/P6_Deaths%20during%20the%20pandemic)
The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered virus. There are more than a 36.1Million deaths due to the virus within 11 months of virus first found. The COVID-19 stands for ‘COrona Virus and Disease started in the year 2019’. The Virus has spread across the globe, the World Health Organization has declared it as a pandemic. Although, there are a big loss due to COVID-19, I was trying to find if there are some other reasons for the death. Also, I am planning to find the friends who are having to suffer the big loss.
In this project, I am planning to research the following questions.
<li> Total number of Deaths due to COVID-19 based on Race.
<li> Total number of Deaths due to different reasons by Race.
<li> Top 10 States where the deaths due to COVID-19 is high.
<li> Total number of deaths with age
<li> COVID-19 Death vs Pneumonia Death by Race.
