In the final milestone, the data analysis of the books dataset. The primary intention of the project is to combine the 3 datasets from 3 different sources using the common columns and perform the necessary analysis. Some of the questions as part of my analysis are listed below.
•         The comparison of ratings from different sources.
•         Top 10 books which have been sold and sales in dollars.
•         Which language has the most percentage of books?
•         Under which rating do most books fall.
•         With the increased number of pages, how likely it to get more ratings.
