## Abstract
Credit card fraud is one of the major problems in financial services. This will cost billions of dollars every year. The United States is the most credit card fraud-prone country in the world. During the pandemic, the number of credit transactions and online shopping has increased, and this results in an increase in the number of credit card fraud activities. Fraudsters always work to find new means to conduct fraud in credit card transactions. Losses to financial institutions can be avoided by detecting credit card fraud and alerting banks about potentially fraudulent transactions. With the available credit card fraud dataset, I will perform some graph analysis to understand the dataset. There could be false positive or false negative fraud detection. We may need to perform scaling on the dataset. I will be using machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. Companies like Visa are looking to identify new solutions using artificial intelligence to solve credit card fraud. Having a fraud transaction will create a business impact too. Because the customer will be losing the trust in the financial institution. So, credit card companies need to recognize fraud transitions to keep the customers not charged for wrong items and keep them happy. For my analysis the dataset from the Kaggle.
